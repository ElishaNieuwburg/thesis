# Detecting Surface Damage on Wind Turbines
## MSc Thesis AI - Maastricht University

### Overview
This repository contains the code for my MSc project for the study Artificial Intelligence at Maastricht University. With this code you can detect surface damage on wind turbines using the YOLOv5 object detection model. Furthermore you can create class activation maps with Eigen-CAM of the images.

### Get started
Run the tutorial python notebook in Google Colab to run YOLOv5 inference on the test images in data and create Eigen-CAM visualizations on them. The rest of the code in this repository can be used for data processing. The data used for this project can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajifoster3/yolo-annotated-wind-turbines-586x371.

### Info
This project and code was made for Accenture.
